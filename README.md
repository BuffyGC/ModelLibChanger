# ModelLibChanger for MSFS  
ModelLibChanger renames incorrect modelLib.BGL files in your community folder and changes the corresponding layout.json..
This prevents various CTD if add-ons are installed that use the same file name.

Link to official forum: Scenery creators: please move or rename your modelLib.BGL

This app is experimental. Despite intensive testing, errors may occur. Please backup your community folder before the changes.
# Installation
Unzip the files to a folder of your choice and run "ModelLibChanger".
